		title: "Iâ€™m Kunj Kansara. I live in Canada, where I design the future.",
		description:
			"I have built experience across customer service, logistics, financial advising, and team leadership. At Amazon, I worked as a Logistics Associate where I managed order processing, inventory tracking, and ensured timely deliveries in a fast-paced environment. At Walmart, I gained strong customer service skills by assisting shoppers, operating self-checkout systems, and supporting smooth front-end operations. Currently, I serve as a Food Service Supervisor at Wayback Burgers, where I lead daily operations, coordinate team members, and maintain service quality, while also working as a Financial Advisor and Insurance Agent with World Financial Group, helping clients understand financial products, choose suitable insurance coverage, and plan for long-term security. This mix of roles has allowed me to develop strong problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills while working with both teams and clients.",
